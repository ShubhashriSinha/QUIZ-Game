# QUIZ-Game
A quiz game in Golang with time limit for solving each question
Also it will calculate your total score at the end

## Problem statement

Create a program that will read in a quiz provided via a CSV file and will then give the quiz to a user keeping track of how many questions they get right and how many they get incorrect. Regardless of whether the answer is correct or wrong the next question should be asked immediately afterwards.

At the end of the quiz the program should output the total number of questions correct and how many questions there were in total. Questions given invalid answers are considered incorrect.

Also add a timer. The Quiz should stop as soon as the time limit has exceeded. At the end of the quiz the program should still output the total number of questions correct and how many questions there were in total. Questions given invalid answers or unanswered are considered incorrect.
